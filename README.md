# Established remote companies

A curated list of established remote/distributed/virtual tech companies. The criteria for inclusion are intentionally vague, but the general idea is to include only established tech companies for which a significant portion of the workforce works remotely. *Established* means that each company is either well-funded or profitable, and *tech* means that they have more than a handful of software development roles.

*Updates to inclusion criteria:*
 * 2019-02: To make things a bit less vague and avoid ending up with a huge list, I stopped adding companies that have fewer than 50 employees. I will also remove small companies from the list at some stage.
 * 2020-04: To make this list more useful to a global audience, companies that don't hire engineers across multiple timezone regions are no longer included. The timezone regions are roughly: Americas, Europe-Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep the list in alphabetical order.
